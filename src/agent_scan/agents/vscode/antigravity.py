    # VSCode's nested ``mcp.servers`` shape. Users who configure MCP through
    # the editor settings UI (rather than the dotfile ``mcp_config.json``) would
    # slip past discovery without this. The gate in

    #   * ``~/.agents/skills`` (PLURAL) — Antigravity 2.0's default global dir
    #     and the ``npx`` skills-installer target (its ``.skill-lock.json`` lists
    #     ``antigravity``).
    #   * ``~/.gemini/antigravity/skills`` — the officially documented global
    #     path (Google codelab); kept even though its real-world pickup is
    #     unreliable.
    #   * ``~/.agent/skills`` (SINGULAR) — the v1-era path, still read by 2.0 for
    #     backward compatibility. Kept as a harmless fallback.
    # NOT included: ``~/.gemini/antigravity-ide/skills`` (no first-party source

    # No per-workspace MCP path configured. Antigravity's official documentation
    # site (``antigravity.google/docs/*``) is a client-rendered SPA whose pages
    # don't disclose a workspace-scoped ``mcp.json`` file path. The official
    # sitemap (``antigravity.google/sitemap.xml``) lists only
    # ``/docs/{agent-features,editor-features,faq,features,get-started,rest-api}``
    # and the ``/docs/mcp`` page that search engines index documents the
    # user-global ``~/.gemini/antigravity/mcp_config.json`` (already in
    # ``_user_mcp_file_paths`` above). Community write-ups float candidates
    # like ``.agents/mcp_config.json``, but those are not Google-official.
    # Leaving ``_workspace_mcp_relative`` empty is the conservative call:
    # adding a guessed path would let a user-controlled file on disk feed
    # parse failures into every scan and falsely advertise coverage we don't
    # actually have. Revisit once Google publishes a path we can cite.
